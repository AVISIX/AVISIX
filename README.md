### Hello, World! :sunglasses:

My name is **Avi** or **Six**. 
I'm a young and passionate mostly self-taught software engineer, who specializes in .NET. 
I started coding with 11-12~ and have been coding ever since, developing and learning new projects and interests on an almost daily basis.
I'm fully employed and spend my free time learning, coding & researching about new topics that might interest me. 

Most of my repositories are set to private and my public ones aren't really that interesting, but if you want you can still have a look around :grin:
